"""
Calculate the letter grade earned in a given course.

Prompt the user to enter the grades earned on different components of the
course.  Valid grades range from 0 to 100.
If 4 or more grades are entered, drop the lowest grade.
Calculate the average assuming equal weights.
The average is rounded to the nearest decimal.
The letter grade is determined based on the following scale:
90 and above: A
80 - 89.9:  B
70 - 79.9: C
60 - 69.9: D
below 60: F
